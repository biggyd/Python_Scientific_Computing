# Python Scientific Computing Course
## Programming Assignment 1
The first assignment of this Python course is to use the packages and commands learned in Chapter 1 - Chapter 2 to produce
a few plots using data from the UCI Machine Learning Respository. The submission should include the following components:
* Your raw codes (.py form). Note: All codes must be properly commented!
* A written report with at least 4 figures. Each figure should be accompanied with a paragraph of explanation (<100 words).
* A README.txt file, stating which data you are using, and why your data fit your analyses (optional)

## Submission
Compile all your files in a zipped folder, and submit it to the 'Project 1 Submission' under the ISSUES tab at this GitHub 
project. There is no deadline.

 The purpose of this project is just to integrate what you have learned so far, and write some Python codes yourself independently. 
 
 Good Luck!
